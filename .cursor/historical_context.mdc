# Historical Context

## 2025-11-25

### Mapped ALL Project Images to Gallery

**File:** `lib/data.ts` (lines 37-103)

**Change:** 
- Added `generateImages()` helper function for numbered image paths
- Updated ALL 9 projects to include every numbered image from their folders
- Added exported `Project` type for type safety

**File:** `app/projects/[id]/ProjectDetailClient.tsx` (line 9)

**Change:** Import `Project` type from `@/lib/data` instead of local definition

**Result:** Clicking any project now shows full gallery of all images (1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.)
