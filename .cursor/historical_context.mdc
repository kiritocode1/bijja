# Historical Context

## 2025-11-25

### Masonry Gallery Layout

**File:** `app/projects/[id]/ProjectDetailClient.tsx` (lines 85-117)

**Change:** Replaced vertical stack gallery with CSS masonry columns:
- 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- Asymmetric aspect ratios (4:3, 1:1, 3:4) based on index
- Hover effects with scale + overlay
- Figure numbering (X.Y format)

---

### Mapped ALL Project Images to Gallery

**File:** `lib/data.ts` (lines 37-103)

**Change:** 
- Added `generateImages()` helper function for numbered image paths
- Updated ALL 9 projects to include every numbered image from their folders
- Added exported `Project` type for type safety

**File:** `app/projects/[id]/ProjectDetailClient.tsx` (line 9)

**Change:** Import `Project` type from `@/lib/data` instead of local definition

**Result:** Clicking any project now shows full gallery of all images (1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.)

### Added SATHYA CONSULTANTS Experience

**File:** `lib/data.ts` (lines 23-28)

```typescript

  company: "SATHYA CONSULTANTS, Bengaluru",
  period: "AUG 2022 - DEC 2022",
  details: ["Detailed CAD drawings", "Handmade cardboard model", "3D Sketches"],
}
```
